# eri_global food systems faculty directory
This app was built to host all faculty involved in food systems research in a simple database.

# File structure
The main list of faculty (faculty_list) is stored in the data folder. All faculty information should be edited in that csv file either in google sheets (its original form) or in R. This includes: faculty image and website URLs, keywords, etc.  

# Site images
All site images (non-faculty images) have to be stored in the www folder in the directory or they can't be read into the app. 

# Styling
The site is styled to the default "darkly" theme but any styling can be updated to that in the css file in the data/style folder.
